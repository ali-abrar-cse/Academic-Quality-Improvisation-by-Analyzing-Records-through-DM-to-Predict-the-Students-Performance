# Academic Quality Improvisation by Analyzing the Historical Records through Data Mining (DM) to Predict the Future Outcome of the Undergraduate Students for the Betterment of their Education

# Abstract
This paper is an endeavor to use the information on mining processes to assist in enhancing the standard of the upper education system by evaluating student data to review the most attributes that will affect the scholar performance in courses. Instructional systems would like innovative ways in which to boost the standard of education to realize the most effective results and reduce the failure rate. Instructional data processing (EDM) has bloomed within the instructional systems recently because it allows to research and predicts student performance so that measures are often taken before. Because of the dearth of prediction accuracy, improper attribute analysis, and meager datasets, the academic systems face difficulties and challenges exist to effectively get pleasure from EDM. To boost the prediction method, a variety of the most effective prediction technique is extremely necessary. The most objective of this paper is to gift a comparative study of assorted recently used data processing techniques, classification algorithms, their impact on datasets still because the prediction attributeâ€™s lead to a transparent and brief approach. The paper conjointly identifies the most effective attributes which will facilitate in predicting student performance in an economical approach.
